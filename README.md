## Overview

<a href="#">DataGrip for macOS</a> is built for professionals who handle multiple databases and want one consistent tool for all of them. It supports major engines such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server and more, each through a unified interface. Once connections are configured, schemas appear in familiar trees that allow quick navigation to tables, views, procedures and functions. This lets users move between technologies without constantly re-learning different client tools.

The editor provides rich code intelligence, from completion and inspections to refactorings like renaming columns safely. Queries can be split into consoles per connection or task, making experimentation less risky. With <a href="#">data viewers and editing controls</a>, results can be filtered, sorted and modified with awareness of keys and constraints. DataGrip keeps track of console histories and local history, helping recover past work or understand how a query evolved over time.

On macOS, the application aligns with other JetBrains tools, making it comfortable for developers already using their IDEs. It runs well as a central SQL workbench alongside terminals and services. As teams grow, DataGrip often becomes the shared standard for database access, analysis and maintenance.
